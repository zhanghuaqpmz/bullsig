# bullsig
BULLSIG is a co-signing software based on SECP256K1 ECDSA which can allow any count of parties to take part in the signing.  To sign any info must get all parties agreement, Any party doesnot agree to sign then you cannot sign the information. And the signing process does not send privatekey's shadow, but only send middle-signing result, this feature is very important to protect private key.
